### TO DO WHEN GOING TO PROD
- use a different fontawesome kit / set up domains for kit
- change the name of the localstorage for the darkmode for each project
- Change the api url to reflect the needed ones (currently strapi) in App.jsx / Register / Login / etc
- add more keys to authSlice to reflect the need for user info display
